In the third chapter, the author listed twelve factors that contributed to market bubbles. The first is the expansion of capitalism. The author claimed that the world has embraced capitalism since the end of the cold war. Consider the Soviet Union’s breaking up in the late 1970s and Chinese economic reform (Opening of China) in the 1990s. Both became more integrated into the global economy.
#Ownership Society#
In the US, George W. Bush named the society as “Ownership Society”, in which private property is not only for a few capitalists but for everyone. People are encouraged to invest in stock market with their savings in Retirement Saving Account (RSA) as well as purchase homes.
#Corporate Downsizing#
In late 1980, corporates started to downsize and lay off, hurting the loyalty between employers and employees. Note that huge layoffs were rare before the 1970s because they were viewed as “business failure and unacceptable business behavior”. In 1977, Jimmy Carter and his free-market advocates, who were determined to lower consumer price and provoke greater competition, deregulated many industries and created an environment vulnerable to layoffs and bankruptcy. In early 1980, GE chairman Jack Welch (Neutron Jack) claimed that layoff is a sign of business competitiveness. He was responsible for elimination one job out of every four GE employees, and the total casualty reached 118,000 from 1980 to 1985.
Meanwhile, labor unions have been in decline. Workers sensing less job security decided to be less dependent on employers. They either started a second job (be their own boss) or invest in the financial market to make additional income.
#Celebrity Culture#
Feeling less stable in the local community, people looked for alternative security. The increasing dominance of telecommunication and the rise of celebrity culture, which can be traced back to the success of mass media, attracted people to invest in something more enduring, like houses in glamourous cities and famous vacation areas.
#Defined-Contribution Plan#
People feared that their labor is turning into a commodity traded internationally. To overcome such fear, companies tilted the compensation for management and key employees away from fixed salaries and toward participation, as investors, in the firm. By 1998, employee stock options reached 6.2% of outstanding shares (sampled from 144 largest S&P 500 firms). A side effect of tying compensation to the stock price is that management can make a substantial amount of money if share price exceeds exercise price. Management tends to create an image that the corporate is working towards a brilliant future, which could be misleading to public investors.
