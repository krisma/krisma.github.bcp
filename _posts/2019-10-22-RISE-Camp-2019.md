Last Thursday (10/18) I attended the annual conference RISE Camp hosted by UC Berkeley RISELab. Since Microsoft is one of the major sponsors of RISELab, we get free tickets every year. RISELab has been focusing on “Real-time Intelligent Secure Explainable Systems” (that’s what RISE stands for). It’s one of my favorite conferences since 2017 because it includes hands-on lab exercises, in which we can use the framework they built to solve problems. The problems are organized in a series of jupyter notebooks that every attendee could clone and run right at the event.


One of their most interesting projects is called “Ray”, which has 9K+ stars on Github by the time of this event. To summarize, Ray is a framework in Python which helps users to build and run distributed applications. During the coding session, I tried out the Ray python package to parallelize the run of a user-defined function using the feature called “remote function”. It is smartly designed, such that I only need to add one python decorator right before the function I need to parallelize, and then call ray.get() on the result to actualize the run. 

Here is the first exercise from the Ray tutorial. The original function runs in sequence. With each slow_function call sleeps for 1 sec, the for loop will run in 4 secs.

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function
import os
os._exit(0)
import time
import ray
# A function simulating a more interesting computation that takes one second.
def slow_function(i):
    time.sleep(1)
    return i

start_time = time.time()

results = []
for i in range(4):
  results.append(slow_function(i))
duration = time.time() - start_time
print('Executing the for loop took {:.3f} seconds.'.format(duration))
print('The results are:', results)
print('Run the next cell to check if the exercise was performed correctly.')
```

    Executing the for loop took 4.005 seconds.
    The results are: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    Run the next cell to check if the exercise was performed correctly.
    

**VERIFY:** Run some checks to verify that the changes you made to the code were correct. Some of the checks should fail when you initially run the cells. After completing the exercises, the checks should pass.


```python
assert results == [0, 1, 2, 3], 'Did you remember to call ray.get?'
assert duration < 1.1, ('The loop took {:.3f} seconds. This is too slow.'
                        .format(duration))
assert duration > 1, ('The loop took {:.3f} seconds. This is too fast.'
                      .format(duration))

print('Success! The example took {} seconds.'.format(duration))
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-5-7f1ba102dc0d> in <module>()
          1 assert results == [0, 1, 2, 3], 'Did you remember to call ray.get?'
          2 assert duration < 1.1, ('The loop took {:.3f} seconds. This is too slow.'
    ----> 3                         .format(duration))
          4 assert duration > 1, ('The loop took {:.3f} seconds. This is too fast.'
          5                       .format(duration))
    

    AssertionError: The loop took 4.005 seconds. This is too slow.

This is not necessary since slow_function() in for loop can run in parallel. We will make some change to speed it up!

First, turn `slow_function` into a remote function, then execute the tasks in parallel by calling `slow_function.remote()` and obtaining the results with `ray.get` on the list of returned object IDs.


```python
# A function simulating a more interesting computation that takes one second.
@remote
def slow_function(i):
    time.sleep(1)
    return i

start_time = time.time()

results = []
for i in range(4):
  results.append(slow_function.remote(i))
result = ray.get(results)
duration = time.time() - start_time
print('Executing the for loop took {:.3f} seconds.'.format(duration))
print('The results are:', results)
print('Run the next cell to check if the exercise was performed correctly.')
```

    Executing the for loop took 1.014 seconds.
    The results are: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    Run the next cell to check if the exercise was performed correctly.
    

**VERIFY:** Run some checks to verify that the changes you made to the code were correct. Some of the checks should fail when you initially run the cells. After completing the exercises, the checks should pass.


```python
assert results == [0, 1, 2, 3], 'Did you remember to call ray.get?'
assert duration < 1.1, ('The loop took {:.3f} seconds. This is too slow.'
                        .format(duration))
assert duration > 1, ('The loop took {:.3f} seconds. This is too fast.'
                      .format(duration))

print('Success! The example took {} seconds.'.format(duration))
```

    Success! The example took 1.013681173324585 seconds.
    
As we can see, the parallel run only takes 1 sec, which is expected.
