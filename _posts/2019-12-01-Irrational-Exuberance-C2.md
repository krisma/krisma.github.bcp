The Real Estate Market in Historical Perspective
In the first chapter, the author talks about the boom in stock market. He then points out such boom could influence other markets, like real estate. In the second chapter, the author suggests that even though many people believe that there was similar boom in real estate market, real home price did not increase significantly. He summarizes the reasons for booms and busts in the real home prices in the last few decades.

1918-1919 Great influenza pandemic, infected 28% of Americans and killed 675,000 of them
1920-1921 Severe recession
1930 Great depression
1942 Home prices started to increase, before end of WW2
1944 The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act (G.I. Bill) subsidizes home purchases (low interest, 0 down payment)
1944 142,000 new homes built
1950 1,952,000 new homes built
2000 home prices started to increase significantly 

He points out that the real home prices in the US, which is calculated relative to CPI (consumer price index), were only 66% higher in 2004 than in 1890, or 0.4% a year. The author digs deeper to the psychology behind this phenomenon and gives a couple of explanation. 
The first reason is that real home prices is calculated relative to CPI, an index that measures the prices paid by consumers for goods and services (investment doesn’t count). The reader must notice that CPI rose 8 folds from 1948 to 2004. {IMAGE CPI graph}. If we compare the boom in real estate market to other market, it is no longer that noticeable. Everything is much cheaper in 1948.

The second reason is that people still remember the prices at which they purchase their homes many years ago because homes are traded infrequently. For example, the same home purchased in 1948 at $16,000 could be sold at $190,000 in 2004. Note that this absolute difference in price is not relative to CPI. Unlike stock market, in which most companies tend to maintain their price at about $30 per share by splitting or reverse splitting, real estate market doesn’t have such adjustment on home prices. 

Also, let’s not forget that technological progress in construction helps to lower the building cost. Unlike teachers and lawyers, who are pretty much doing the same things as they do many decades ago, home builds take advantage of new materials and equipment, along with more mechanized procedure of construction to build houses faster, and at lower cost.
